# Vegan "Tenderloin" Using Seitan #

Originally, this recipe was referred to as Vegan Brisket, but it's definitely closer to tenderloin in style.

## Step 0: Invent the Universe ##

## Step 1: Make Seitan ##

### Ingredients ###

* Vital Wheat Gluten - 1.5 cup
* Nutritional Yeast Flakes - 0.25 cup

* Ice Water - 1 cup
* Low Sodium Soy Sauce - .333 cup
* Ketchup - 1 TBSP
* Garlic Cloves - 2 cloves, finely minced
* Finely Grated Lemon Zest - 1 TSP
* Paprika - 2 TSP
* Cumin - 0.25 TSP
* Ground Black Pepper - 1 TSP
* Chili Powder - 0.5 TSP

#### Liquid For Simmering ####

* Ice Water - 10 cups
* Low Sodium Soy Sauce - .333 cup

### Directions ###
1. Combine gluten and nutritional yeast in a large bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together ice water (1 cup), soy sauce, ketchup, garlic, lemon zest and spices.
3. Stir until ice is nearly melted.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and combine.
5. Knead dough in the bowl for about 3 minutes until you have a spongy dough log. Leave any excess liquid in the bowl. Let rest for a few minutes, then shape into a log about 7 or 8 inches long. Cut into 3 equal pieces.
6. Put the 10 cups ice water (make sure it's very cold, otherwise the seitan will get crumbly) and soy sauce in a large saucepan and gently put the pieces of dough in the liquid.
7. Partially cover the pot and bring to a boil.
8. Lower heat and simmer for 60 minutes, turning the pieces occasionally.
9. Let cool for 10 minutes, then remove the seitan.
10. As soon as it's cool enough to handle, squeeze out all the liquid you can, being careful not to break the hunks of seitan. 
11. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap or place in a sealed bag and refrigerate for several hours or overnight.

## Step 2: Dry Rub and Smoke ##

### Ingredients ###
* Paprika - 3 TBSP
* Ground Black Pepper - 1 TBSP
* Sugar - 1 TBSP
* Chili Powder - 1 TBSP
* Garlic Powder - 2 TSP
* Onion Powder - 2 TSP
* Cayenne Pepper - 1 TSP
* Dry Mustard Powder - 0.5 TSP

### Directions ###
1. Start a fire in your smoker.
2. Soak wood chips (preferably hickory) for 45 minutes or more.
3. Coat the seitan pieces in the dry rub mixture and put it on a grill basket or right on the grate.
4. Throw some wood chips on the hot coals and close the cover.
5. Smoke for 90 minutes at 225 degrees fahrenheit, adding more soaked wood chips occasionally.
